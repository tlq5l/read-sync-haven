# BondWise Vercel Deployment Error Fix Plan

## Problem Description

When deploying the BondWise application to Vercel, the build process fails with the following error:

```

}
Node.js v22.14.0
Error: Command "npm run build" exited with 1
```

## Root Cause Analysis

After analyzing the error and examining the relevant files, we've identified the following root causes:

1. **Rollup Native Module Compatibility Issue**: 
   - Rollup version 4.21.3 is trying to load native binary modules based on the platform and architecture
   - The error occurs in the `native.js` file which attempts to load a platform-specific native addon
   - Vercel's build environment with Node.js v22.14.0 is unable to find or load the appropriate native module

2. **Node.js Version Compatibility**:
   - The deployment is using Node.js v22.14.0, which is a newer version
   - While Rollup supports Node.js >=18.0.0, there might be specific issues with the native modules on Node.js 22.x

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Use WebAssembly (WASM) Version of Rollup (Recommended)

The error message in `native.js` specifically suggests using the WASM build of Rollup when the native binary is not available:

```
"Please use the WASM build "@rollup/wasm-node" instead."
```

This is the most reliable approach as the WASM build is designed for cross-platform compatibility.

**Implementation Steps:**

1. Add `@rollup/wasm-node` as a dependency
2. Configure the build to use this instead of the native version
3. Update necessary configurations

### Option 2: Specify a Compatible Node.js Version on Vercel

As an alternative, we can specify a Node.js version that is known to work with Rollup's native bindings:

1. Add a `.node-version` or `package.json` engine constraint to specify a Node.js version (like 18.x)
2. Configure Vercel to use this specific Node.js version

## Implementation Plan

We'll proceed with Option 1 as the primary solution because it directly addresses the root cause and is specifically recommended in the error message.

### Steps to Implement:

1. Add `@rollup/wasm-node` as a dependency:
   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev @rollup/wasm-node
   ```

2. Create a Vercel configuration file (`vercel.json`) to use the WASM build environment:
   ```json
   {
     "builds": [
       {
         "src": "package.json",
         "use": "@vercel/node",
         "config": {
           "buildCommand": "npm run build"
         }
       }
     ],
     "env": {
       "ROLLUP_WASM_NODE": "true"
     }
   }
   ```

3. Update the vite.config.ts to conditionally use the WASM build for Rollup when in a Vercel environment:
   ```typescript
   // Add this to the vite.config.ts
   build: {
     // ... existing config
     // Use WASM build when in Vercel environment
     rollupOptions: {
       // ... existing config
       // Add this condition to use WASM in Vercel environment
       ...((process.env.VERCEL || process.env.ROLLUP_WASM_NODE) && {
         wasm: true
       })
     }
   }
   ```

4. As a fallback, we'll also add a Node.js version constraint in package.json:
   ```json
   "engines": {
     "node": "18.x"
   }
   ```

## Expected Outcome

After implementing these changes, the build process on Vercel should successfully complete without the native module errors. The application will use the WASM build of Rollup which is compatible across different environments and Node.js versions.

## Monitoring and Validation

After deployment, we should:

1. Monitor the build logs to ensure no further MODULE_NOT_FOUND errors occur
2. Verify that the application functions correctly in the Vercel environment
3. Conduct basic functionality tests to ensure all features work as expected
